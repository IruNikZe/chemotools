## Welcome to chemotools! ðŸ–– 

This project is an implementation of spectral preprocessing techniques integrated with the widely popular sklearn API, providing you with an easy-to-use toolkit for analyzing and manipulating your data. With this integration, you can easily apply techniques such as spectral derivative, scatter correction or baseline removal to your datasets.

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly package for spectral preprocessing, with a focus on making it accessible to a wide range of users, from data scientists to researchers to curious learners. By integrating these techniques with the powerful sklearn API, I enable users to easily build machine learning and chemometric models on top of preprocessed data, making it possible to identify patterns and make predictions with greater accuracy.

In this repository, you will find a range of tools and resources for using spectral preprocessing techniques with the sklearn API, including code samples, documentation, and examples. I encourage contributions from the community, whether through bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests, to help us make this project even better.

In addition, I take great care to ensure that all functions are thoroughly unit tested for both API compatibility and functionality. I believe that unit testing is an essential part of any software development process, and it is particularly important for a project like this, which aims to provide reliable data analysis tools. I hope that this project will serve as a useful resource for anyone interested in learning more about spectral preprocessing and machine learning.

Thank you for your interest in this project, and I hope you find it useful for your data analysis and machine learning needs.

## __Installation ðŸš€__
This package is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install chemotools
```

The package can be updated using the following command:

```bash
pip install chemotools --upgrade
```

## __Integration with scikit-learn__

### __Working with single spectra (1D arrays)__
Preprocessing techniques in scikit-learn are primarily designed to work with 2D arrays, where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature (i.e., matrices). However, in spectroscopy, single spectra are often of interest, which are represented as 1D arrays (i.e., vectors). To apply scikit-learn and chemotools techniques to single spectra, they need to be reshaped into 2D arrays (i.e., a matrix with one row). To achieve this, you can use the following code that reshapes a 1D array into a 2D array with a single row:

```python
import numpy as np

from chemotools.scatter import MultiplicativeScatterCorrection

msc = MultiplicativeScatterCorrection()
spectra_msc = msc.fit_transform(spectra.reshape(1, -1))
```
The ```.reshape(1, -1)``` method is applied to the 1D array ```spectra```, which is converted into a 2D array with a single row.


### Pipelines integration with scikit-learn
All preprocessing techniques in this package are compatible with ```scikit-learn``` and can be used in pipelines. For example, the following code creates a pipeline that performs multiplicative scatter correction, followed by a min-max scaling and a Savitzky-Golay smoothing:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

pipeline = make_pipeline(AirPls(), MultiplicativeScatterCorrection(), StandardScaler(with_std=False)) 
spectra_transformed = pipeline.fit_transform(spectra)
```

{% include pipeline.html  %}



## __Scatter__

This package contains three common algorithms for scatter correction in spectroscopy:

- Multiplicative scatter correction (MSC)
- Standard normal variate (SNV)
- Extended multiplicative scatter correction (EMSC)

### __Multiplicative scatter correction__
Multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) is a preprocessing technique in spectroscopy that corrects for the influence of light scattering on spectral measurements by dividing each spectrum by a scatter reference spectrum. The current implementation, accepts three types of reference spectra:

- The mean spectrum of the dataset (_default_).
- The median spectrum of the dataset.
- A single spectrum that is used to correct all spectra in the dataset.

Usage example for a single reference spectrum:

Usage example for the mean spectrum:

```python
from chemotools.scatter import MultiplicativeScatterCorrection

msc = MultiplicativeScatterCorrection()
spectra_msc = msc.fit_transform(spectra)
``` 

Usage example for the median spectrum:

```python
from chemotools.scatter import MultiplicativeScatterCorrection

msc = MultiplicativeScatterCorrection(use_median=True)
spectra_msc = msc.fit_transform(spectra)
``` 

Usage example for a single reference spectrum:

```python
from chemotools.scatter import MultiplicativeScatterCorrection

msc = MultiplicativeScatterCorrection(reference=reference_spectrum)
spectra_msc = msc.fit_transform(spectra)
```

{% include multiplicative_signal_correction.html  %}

### __Standard normal variate__
Standard normal variate (SNV) is a preprocessing technique in spectroscopy that adjusts for baseline shifts and variations in signal intensity by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each spectrum.

Usage example for a single reference spectrum:

```python
from chemotools.scatter import StandardNormalVariate

snv = StandardNormalVariate()
spectra_snv = snv.fit_transform(spectra)
```
{% include standard_normal_variate.html  %}


### __Extended multiplicative scatter correction__
Extended multiplicative scatter correction (EMSC) is a preprocessing technique in spectroscopy that corrects for the influence of light scattering and instrumental drift by fitting a mathematical model to a reference spectrum and using it to normalize all spectra in the dataset.

An implementation of the EMSC will be available soon ðŸ¤“.

## __Derivatives__

This package contains two common algorithms for calculating derivatives in spectroscopy:

- Savitzky-Golay derivative
- William Norris derivative

### __Savitzky-Golay derivative__
Savitzky-Golay derivative is a preprocessing technique in spectroscopy that calculates the derivative of a spectrum by fitting a polynomial to a window of adjacent points and calculating the derivative of the polynomial.

The following arguments can be set:

- ```window_size: int```: The length of the window. Must be an odd integer number. _Default: 5_.
- ```polynomial_order: int```: The order of the polynomial used to fit the samples. Must be less than ```window_size```. _Default: 2_.
- ```derivative_order: int```: The order of the derivative to compute. _Default: 1_.
- ```mode: str```: The mode of the boundary. _Default: 'nearest'_, available options: ```'nearest'```, ```'constant'```, ```'reflect'```, ```'wrap'```, ```'mirror'```, ```'interp'```. See the [official documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.savgol_filter.html) for more information.

Usage example:

```python
from chemotools.derivative import SavitzkyGolay

sg = SavitzkyGolay(window_size=15, polynomial_order=2, derivate_order=1)
spectra_derivative = sg.fit_transform(spectra)
```

{% include savitzky_golay_derivative.html  %}

### __William Norris derivative__
William Norris derivative is a preprocessing technique in spectroscopy that calculates the derivative of a spectrum using finite differences.

The following arguments can be set:

- Non-negative
- Subtract reference spectrum

### __Linear baseline correction__

Usage example:

```python
from chemotools.baseline import LinearCorrection

lc = LinearCorrection()
spectra_baseline = lc.fit_transform(spectra)
```
{% include linear_baseline_correction.html  %}


### __Polynomial baseline correction__
âœ¨ New in version 0.0.11 âœ¨ - Polynomial baseline correction is a preprocessing technique in spectroscopy that approximates a baseline by fitting a polynomial to selected points of the spectrum. The selected points often correspond to minima in the spectra, and are selected by their index (not by the wavenumber). If no points are selected, the algorithm will select all the points in the spectrum to fit a polynomial of a given order. This case is often called detrending in other spectral processing software.

The following arguments can be set:

- ```order: int``` The order of the polynomial used to fit the samples. _Default: 1_.
- ```indices: list``` The indices of the points to use for fitting the polynomial. _Default: None_ 

(âœ¨ note this is new in version 0.0.11, in previous versions the indices had to be specified as a tuple âœ¨)

Usage example:

```python
from chemotools.baseline import PolynomialCorrection

pc = PolynomialCorrection(order=2, indices=[0, 75, 150, 200, 337])
spectra_baseline = pc.fit_transform(spectra)
```
{% include polynomial_baseline_correction.html  %}

### __Cubic spline baseline correction__
âœ¨ New in version 0.0.11 âœ¨ - Cubic spline baseline correction is a preprocessing technique in spectroscopy that approximates a baseline by fitting a cubic spline to selected points of the spectrum. Similar to the ```PolynomialCorrection```, the selected points often correspond to minima in the spectra, and are selected by their index (not by the wavenumber). If no points are selected, the algorithm will select the first and last point of the spectrum. 

The following arguments can be set:
- ```indices: list``` The indices of the points to use for fitting the polynomial. _Default: None_. 

(âœ¨ note this is new syntax in version 0.0.11, in previous versions the indices had to be specified as tuples âœ¨).


Usage example:

```python
from chemotools.baseline import CubicSplineCorrection

cspl = CubicSplineCorrection(indices=[0, 75, 150, 200, 337])
spectra_baseline = cspl.fit_transform(spectra)
```

{% include cubic_spline_baseline_correction.html  %}

### __Alternate iterative reweighed penalized least squares (AIRPLS) baseline correction__
It is an automated baseline correction algorithm that uses a penalized least squares approach to fit a baseline to a spectrum. The original algorithm is based on the paper by [Zhang et al.](https://pubs.rsc.org/is/content/articlelanding/2010/an/b922045c). The current implementation is based on the Python implementation by [zmzhang](https://github.com/zmzhang/airPLS).

The following arguments can be set:

Usage example:

```python
from chemotools.baseline import AirPls

airpls = AirPls()
spectra_baseline = airpls.fit_transform(spectra)
```

{% include airpls_baseline_correction.html  %}

### __Non-negative__
Non-negative baseline correction is a preprocessing technique in spectroscopy that corrects for baseline by removing negative values from a spectrum. Negative values are either replaced by 0, or set to their absolute value.

The following arguments can be set:
- ```mode: str``` If ```'zero'```, negative values are replaced by 0. If ```'abs'```, negative values are set to their absolute value. _Default: ```'zero'```_.

Usage example:

```python
from chemotools.baseline import NonNegative

nnz = NonNegative(mode='zero')
nna = NonNegative(mode='abs')
spectra_nnz = nnz.fit_transform(spectra_baseline)
spectra_nna = nna.fit_transform(spectra_baseline)
```

{% include non_negative_zero_baseline_correction.html  %}
{% include non_negative_abs_baseline_correction.html  %}

### __Subtract reference spectrum__
âœ¨ New in version 0.0.11 âœ¨ - Subtract reference spectrum is a preprocessing technique in spectroscopy that subtracts a reference spectrum from a target spectrum. The reference spectrum must be a single spectrum. The target spectrum can be a single spectrum or a list of spectra.

The following arguments can be set:
- ```reference: np.array``` The reference spectrum. _Default: None_. When it is set to None, the algorithm will not subtract the reference spectrum.


Usage example:

```python
from chemotools.baseline import SubtractReference

sr = SubtractReference(reference=reference_spectrum)

spectra_norm = sgf.fit_transform(spectra)
```

{% include savitzky_golay_smoothing.html  %}

### __Whittaker smoother__
It is an automated smoothing algorithm that uses a penalized least squares approach to iteratively apply a smoothing operation to the data  by minimizing a penalty function that balances the degree of smoothness and the fidelity to the original data.
